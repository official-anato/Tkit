This README simply exists for no reason, i don't plan to add anything special here, but if you wanna contact me, my discord is @official_anato.

incase you wanna know, these are commands that i use:
```
git clone https://github.com/official-anato/tkit&&clear&&yes|apt install python3-pip&&clear&&yes|pip install keyboard&&clear&&yes|apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev&&clear&&yes|pip install pyautogui&&clear&&yes|apt install gnome-screenshot&&clear&&yes|pip install pynput&&clear && cd tkit

clear && python3 rename.py && clear
```

the last one might look like a bunch bloat, but that's gonna be needed eventually in this wrapper.
